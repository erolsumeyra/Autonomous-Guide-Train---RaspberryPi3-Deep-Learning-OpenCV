- The means of transportation with the lowest accident rate in recent years is the airline and then the railway. In addition rail travel has become a preferred means of transportation by the public. However, in Turkey 150-200 deaths per 100 million passengers carried annually as a result of rail transport-related accidents is taking place. According to these statistics, the number of deaths and injuries in train accidents in recent years is quite a lot. Generally, train accidents are caused by defects in the rails and guide train. The reason for most of the accidents is the lack of security systems, malfunction, and the natural are the elements. It was designed in addition to these security systems in the project realized. Security Analyzes were made on real-time images to increase the level. Deep learning and imagery using processing technologies, bending, breaking, landslides, living creatures falling on the train tracks lifeless obstacles, human and vehicle elements at level crossings were detected. Obstacle or The broken rail is designed to detect and stop with an autonomous guide train and give a warning to the relevant units. Thanks to this project, not only high-speed train lines but also all railway lines in our country were controlled. and in this way, it is aimed to increase the safety of train services. Thanks to sufficient equipment, It is also aimed to contribute to national technologies with the object detection software prepared.
